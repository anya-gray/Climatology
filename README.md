# Climatology
Group Project for Theoretical &amp; Applied Climatology. Anya, Annabelle and Jamie

This project is an Empiracle Orthogonal Function (EOF) Analysis of 4 datasets to quantify dominant variables in the Pacific Ocean, particularly relevant during the El Nino cycle. Data used are latitudinal and longitudinal wind speeds, atmospheric air pressure at sea level, and sea surface temperature. The analysis is carried out in Python (with development done using Jupyter Notebooks) using NetCDF and xarray. The file 'ENSO_EOF_Analyis.py' contains all analysis code, including producing and saving the figures in this repo.
